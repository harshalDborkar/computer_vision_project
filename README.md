## This repository contains implementations of three key computer vision algorithms using OpenCV in Python:

### SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) – to detect and match keypoints between two images.
### RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) – to remove outlier keypoint matches and fit a transformation model.
### Harris Corner Detector – to detect and visualize corner points in grayscale images.
